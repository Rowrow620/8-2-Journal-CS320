-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that code is functional or secure, there are many different approaches a developer can take. One approach would be to secure code and assure functionality through junit testing and other testing techniques. For instance, one of these testing techniques that can be used is assertions. Assertions are a way to see if the code produces the result that is expected. Another way to assure functionality would be exception testing. Exception testing would see if the code is able to properly throw an exception when it is found.

-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are one of the most important things to take into account when designing software. Of these needs, the most important would be what would be designated as requirements. Knowing what is needed for the app to at least satisfy the user in the most basic form is a strong way to approach software design. Secondly, feedback throughout the development process is important to have software to satisfies users.
-How do I approach designing software?
To desgin software, we must first have an overall idea of what we are trying to design. Although ideas can be tweaked as they go, have a guideline or endgoal is stronger than having a vague idea of what to do. For example, planning what functions to have will allow a developer to design the software with a stronger code quality.
